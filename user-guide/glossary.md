# Glossary

## Rust
A systems programming language that guarantees memory safety, thread safety, and zero-cost abstractions. Rust combines low-level control over performance with high-level ergonomics and powerful static analysis that prevents common programming errors. [Official Rust Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Leptos
A full-stack Rust web framework for building reactive web applications. Leptos allows developers to write both client and server code in Rust, featuring a component model similar to React/Solid.js but with Rust's safety guarantees. [Leptos Documentation](https://leptos.dev/)

## Redpanda
A modern streaming data platform that's API-compatible with Apache Kafka but significantly faster and simpler to operate. Written in C++, it eliminates the need for ZooKeeper and provides better performance with lower operational overhead. [Redpanda Website](https://redpanda.com/)

## ScyllaDB
A real-time big data database that's API-compatible with Apache Cassandra but rewritten in C++ for better performance. ScyllaDB offers consistent single-digit millisecond latencies and high throughput for large-scale applications. [ScyllaDB Website](https://www.scylladb.com/)

## PostgreSQL
An advanced, open-source relational database system with over 30 years of active development. PostgreSQL offers robust features including complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, updatable views, and multiversion concurrency control (MVCC). [PostgreSQL Website](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Mermaid Charts
A JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that renders text definitions into diagrams. It allows creation of diagrams, flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more using a simple markdown-like syntax. Mermaid is widely supported in documentation tools and version control platforms. [Mermaid JS Website](https://mermaid.js.org/)

## GitHub
A web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. GitHub provides hosting for software development and version control, along with features like bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for projects. It's the largest host of source code in the world. [GitHub Website](https://github.com/)

## Subscribe
A person that is subscribed has the chance of being chosen for an event held in their region.  They will receive a mailing to their mailing address on record.  Mailing addresses are used in order to sort by region.  It is important that a fair chance is distributed according to regional proportions by county population

## Region
Locations within certain counties designated by county code and/or postal zip code around a venue.  County codes for a state can be found at the [census site](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html#cou) from there, choose a state to see the county codes.

## Regional Proportions by County Population
Calculating the number of people from a county that will be eligible for random draw this period uses numbers from [Secretary of State Voter Demographics Tables](https://www.sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/research/$year-03%20Voter%20Demographics%20Tables.xlsx)
